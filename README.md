# 3D

We build and publish the first benchmark dataset for mesh quality
understanding algorithms. The dataset consists of 24576 meshes with
different sizes, geometries, and models. Each sample in the dataset is
annotated with a quality label after careful numerical simulation and
manual re-checking. 

The benchmark dataset is now publicly available in
